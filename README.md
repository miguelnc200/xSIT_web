# xSIT_web
xSIT (Expected Shot Interference Threat) is an advanced metric that calculates the probability of a shot being interfered with by defensive players. It is based on:

Ball position: Determines the danger zone
Goalkeeper position: Their ability to cover goal areas
Defender positions: Proximity to the ball's trajectory
Shot speed: Affects players' reaction time
The xSIT value is represented as a percentage between 0 (no interference) and 1 (certain interference).
